## **How initialitzate the App**

*At the moment, this is a mobile first (and only) app that uses google maps api, so please put your browser emulating mobile view and enable the geolocation.*

*To initialitzate skysquare, first clone it from github. For the api, you will need a cloudinary account. Please, put your cloudinary config details in a .env file. Then in your console, once you are in the skysquare-api root folder, write the following commands:*

```sh
$ npm i
```
```sh
$ yarn start
```

*Now, go to the skysquare app root folder. For the app, you will need a Google Maps API KEY. Please, put it in a .env file, and then once you are in the skyquare-app root folder, write the following commands:*

```sh
$ npm i
```
```sh
$ yarn start
```
